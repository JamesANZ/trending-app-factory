## 🎨 Design Philosophy

The app itself follows the principles it teaches:

- **Simple HTML Structure**: Clean, semantic markup
- **Minimal CSS**: Modern CSS Grid and Flexbox, no heavy frameworks
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No external dependencies, pure functionality
- **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on all screen sizes
- **Fast Loading**: Optimized for performance

## 🔧 Customization

### Adding New Principles

Edit the `script.js` file and add new principles to the `details` object:

```javascript
'New Principle': {
    description: 'Description of the new principle',
    examples: [
        'Example 1',
        'Example 2'
    ],
    quote: 'Relevant quote'
}
```

### Modifying Styles

The CSS uses CSS custom properties for easy theming. Modify colors in `style.css`:

```css
:root {
  --primary-color: #3b82f6;
  --secondary-color: #64748b;
  --accent-color: #10b981;
}
```

### Adding New Tools

Add new tool categories in the HTML and corresponding styles in CSS.
